## **ABOUT**

Joelma Renata Alves de Oliveira, I'm 24 years old, graduated in Systems Analysis and Development at Faculdade Impacta de Tecnologia. I entered the technology market because I believed it would be good to be challenged every day.  It was in my daily life that I was able to put into practice a good part of the acquired knowledge and also to learn new technologies, as well as to better understand the functioning of the IT teams and the agile methodologies. I have had experience working mainly with front-end, stack React/Redux and also in the backend using NodeJs and Asp Net Core.
In addition, I studied photography, advertising and worked with interior designer and furniture.
